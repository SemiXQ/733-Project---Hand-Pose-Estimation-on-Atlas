# 733-Project---Hand-Pose-Estimation-on-Atlas
This project is to convert existing models to achieve a performance of FPS>=20 on the Atlas 200 DK

We have modified the original pipelines of the model in simple2D and retrained it. The prep_utils.py in ./simple2D/utils is from the original model.

### To run the model in ./handx:
```python runhandx.py```

### To run the model in ./simple2D:
```python runsimple2d.py```
